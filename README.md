## Directory Structure
---
#### `lain`
- One of the libraries used in the theme
#### `freedesktop`
- A library used in the theme
#### `themes` 
- Folder containing all the themes
#### kUbuntu Branch
- A seperate branch is mainted for kUbuntu-specific changes. At the moment, these only consist of a different terminal name (`konsole` vs. `gnome-terminal`), but as enviroments diverge both versions need to be easily accessable. In the future, master may be renamed to a more descriptave name.
